## Project Description

Every account in EVM has an address, derived from a public key, derived from a private key. Public key is simply a coordinate on an "[elliptic-curve](https://www.rareskills.io/post/elliptic-curves-finite-fields)", so basically it is a point $(x, y) \in \mathbb{F}_p^2$ for some large prime $p$ such that it satisfies the following curve equation of [`secp256k1`](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1):

$$
y^2 = x^3 + 7
$$

Since these are points, they have some distance between them as well! With that, we define "being close to each other" on the elliptic curve to mean that you two are "curve frens"!

This project implements the required contract & frontend to implement friendship over elliptic-curves, which may pave new friendship dynamics built upon cryptography.
